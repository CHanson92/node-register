# Registration App

## What is this project?

This project is a basic CRUD App built with Node.js with the Express Framework. You can register, and as an admin you can login, look at the number of registrations and delete accounts.

This was built in order to refresh my backend skills.

## How to run

<code>npm run start</code>

In order to use the admin facilities, here is the login: <code>user: master</code> <code> password: password</code>.

To change the login if you have downloaded the app: You can use [Htpasswd Generator](http://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/) to generate a new <code>ht.passwd</code>.
