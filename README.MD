# Registration App

## What is this project?

This project is a basic CRUD App built with Node.js with the Express Framework. You can register, and as an admin you can login, look at the number of registrations and delete accounts.

This was built in order to refresh my backend skills.

## How to run

<code>npm run start</code>

In order to use the admin facilities, you will need to create a <code>users.htpasswd</code>. You can use [Htpasswd Generator](http://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/) to generate this file as the app has functionality to hash and unhash passwords.
